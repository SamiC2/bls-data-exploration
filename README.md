Project 1 for Columbia AI Bootcamp, researching into BLS Job Data Analysis

## Project Goals:
-> Identify High-Paying Occupations: Find the top occupations earning $100k+ and categorize them by industry, educational requirements, and experience level.
-> Analyze Job Growth and Outlook: Evaluate which high-paying jobs are expected to grow the fastest and what factors influence this.
-> Explore Education and Training Requirements: Investigate the correlation between education level and earnings, focusing on professions requiring advanced degrees.
-> Compare Demographic Trends: Look into how gender, race, or geographic location might influence access to high-paying jobs.
-> Provide Actionable Insights: Offer recommendations for those seeking to enter these lucrative fields, based on qualifications and industry trends.


## Data Preparation:
Youâ€™ve successfully downloaded the Educational Attainment and the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) data. Next, clean and merge this data with the other datasets you have, focusing on key variables like occupation, educational attainment, and wage statistics.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the distributions of educational attainment and wage data.
Identify any correlations between education levels and wages, as well as trends in high-paying jobs.
Investigate any patterns related to occupation codes, wage percentiles, and employment levels.
### Identify High-Paying Jobs:
Based on the educational attainment and wage data, define a "high-paying job" (for example, those earning above $100k annually).
Filter the dataset to identify jobs that meet this criterion.
### Data Modeling:
Use statistical or machine learning models to predict high-paying jobs based on educational attainment, occupation classification, and other relevant factors.
Assess the impact of education on the likelihood of a high-paying job in different industries or sectors.
### Visualization and Reporting:Create visualizations to communicate the relationship between education and income across different occupations.
Provide insights and actionable findings about the education levels required for high-paying jobs.
